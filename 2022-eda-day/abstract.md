# goto-eda-day-talk-Sept-2022
A talk about EDA at cinch alongside Emily Shea from AWS at [GOTO; EDA Day Sept 1st 2022](https://gotoldn.com/2022-eda-aws-day/schedule?date=2022-09-01)

## Abstract 

Event-driven architectures is a powerful way to decouple development teams, allowing them to build autonomously and release new features fast. But what does this look like in practice? In this session, you will hear from AWS and cinch, one of the fastest growing start-ups in the UK. You will learn how cinch built an entirely new event-driven e-commerce platform in just 6 months. We will explore cinchâ€™s architecture and AWS services used, the practices that helped cinch succeed, and the considerations for anyone looking to increase team agility and feature release velocity.
